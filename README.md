# YouCantAlwaysPlantWhatYouWant

The main goal will be to identify how different enviromental variables (temperature, precipitation, etc.) have been changing over key land use areas,
e.g. agriculture and how current trends might not allow to keep those land use activities, hence raising the question about different future land use management.
We will use ERA5-Land data together with land use/land cover geospatial datasets to perform the analysis.
